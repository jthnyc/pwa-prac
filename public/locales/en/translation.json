    "l1": "It was a drizzly Tuesday night....",
    "l2": "Joanna and Gabe first crossed paths on a dark and stormy night (really!) at a fundraiser in midtown Manhattan. They bonded over a mutual love of music and the arts—though they disagreed strongly on whether Lang Lang is a great pianist.",
    "l3": "After a few evenings exchanging Spotify lists, watching films, and discovering a shared appreciation for Eataly, Broadway, and cocktail bars—they knew they had found something special in each other. In the years since, they’ve called the diverse community of Long Island City home, while continuing to explore the arts and culinary scene in New York.",
    "l4": "In 2019, Gabe proposed during a candlelight cruise in the Riviera Maya, Mexico. A year later, Joanna and Gabe were married in an intimate ceremony on October 10, 2020 — as much fun as that was, they can’t wait to celebrate with all of their favorite people.",
    "l5": "They also still disagree on Lang Lang — although they both agree Martha Argerich is better anyway."

    "subt": "We will be updating these regularly!\nIf you can’t find what you’re looking for, please reach out at: ",
    "q1": "Is this the best way to get the latest information about the wedding?",
    "a1": "Yes! We will be updating this website as the year goes on. Please check back for the most updated information.",
    "q2": "What's the best way to reach you if we have questions?",
    "a2": "Please reach us at hello@joannaandgabriel.love",
    "q3": "Will there be a Zoom or livestream of the wedding if I can’t make it?",
    "a3": "Not as of now.",
    "q4": "What if you plan to postpone?",
    "a4": "While we do not anticipate further postponement for a variety of reasons, any announcements about the status of the wedding will be posted on our website first.\nWe plan to contact all guests via phone or other electronic means (email, DM, etc.) if there are urgent updates.\n\nIf you would like us to have your email or phone on file for the latest updates, please feel free to send us an email at hi@joannaandgabriel.love",
    "q5": "Where is your registry?",
    "a5": "We don’t have one—at least in the traditional sense! Under the circumstances and hardships of the past year (and then some), your presence at our event is more than enough.\nWe are truly blessed and are just happy to be celebrating if you are able to join us. That said, we have a feeling that this won’t stop some of you who still feel tradition-bound, in which case we’d like to direct your generosity towards some causes we care deeply about. \nAnd in case any of them don’t move you—or you are just incredibly loving!—we’ll set aside an option for our honeymoon fund. We will provide more detail on giving as we have more to share.",
    "q6": "Which airports are closest?",
    "a6": "For international guests planning to stay in New York City, John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) is likely to be your best option.\nDomestic guests, especially those who are staying in New Jersey, may want to fly into Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) instead.",
    "q7": "Dress code",
    "a7": "The dress code for our wedding is Black Tie (Required). It means wear a tuxedo or an evening gown (see here) and have fun with it!\nEquivalent formal dress in the Taiwanese / Chinese (modern Qipao or Zhongshan suit) and Filipino tradition (Barong tagalog or Maria Clara dress) are also acceptable options."

    "t": "COVID Safety Precautions",
    "subt": "If there is anything we have learned in the last year, it is that health and safety regulations and guidance for the pandemic will continue to evolve on a weekly basis. Bringing together some of the most important people in our lives into the same location all at once (including you!) presents some logistical challenges.\n\nThese guidelines are necessary to avoid compromising anyone whose health is at-risk, and for the comfort and well-being of everyone in attendance. While we recognize that some of these precautions may be inconvenient, there are no exceptions to these guidelines for any of our vendors or guests.\n\nWe thank you in advance for your understanding, and kindly ask that you check this site regularly for updates as we get closer to November.",
    "q-1": "How frequently will you update these guidelines?",
    "a-1": "We expect we’ll have meaningful updates around June. President Biden has instructed all states to make the COVID-19 vaccine eligible to all US adults by May 1st.\nWe are using one month after this date as a milestone for monitoring what initial vaccination rates look like, and therefore what our initial expectation would be for vaccination by our wedding date in November.",
    "q-2": "Will we need to bring masks?",
    "a-2": "Yes. We’ll be reassessing our stance on this and other COVID-related measures as we get closer to the wedding.",
    "q-3": "What if I forget to bring my mask?",
    "a-3": "We will have a small supply of disposable masks as a precaution. You’re highly encouraged to bring your own mask, also so that you can coordinate it with your outfit.",
    "q-4": "When will I need to wear a mask?",
    "a-4": "Currently, masks will need to be worn anytime you are not eating or drinking, or are moving around the venue and are away from your chair or designated table.",
    "q-5": "How is mask wearing going to be enforced?",
    "a-5": "We plan to implement a three strike rule: a reminder, a warning, and then being escorted out of the venue. (So please wear a mask!)",
    "q-6": "Will social distancing be enforced?",
    "a-6": "Yes. Our venue, Weylin, has a maximum capacity which exceeds our guest count by a healthy margin. As a result, we are fortunate to have a bit more flexibility with our seating arrangements and event flow.\n\nWe’re excited to share more as we get closer!",
    "q-7": "Will COVID rapid or PCR testing before the wedding be required?",
    "a-7": "Yes, for everyone has not had a complete vaccination series by our wedding date.",
    "q-8": "I was fully vaccinated. Do I need to present a test?",
    "a-8": "No, but we ask that you provide us with proof of vaccination. We will be collecting vaccination details on a rolling basis from guests as we get closer to the date.\n\nIf you have taken a vaccine that requires a series (Pfizer or AstraZeneca), you will need to have completed both shots. For those who have taken the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, proof of vaccination is sufficient.",
    "q-9": "I have not been vaccinated or don’t plan to be. Do I need to present a test?",
    "a-9": "Yes, you will need to provide a negative PCR or rapid test.",
    "q-10": "What kind of COVID tests will be required?",
    "a-10": "For non-vaccinated guests, we will require either of the following at the door prior to entering the venue.\n\n1. A negative PCR test. Results must be returned within 72 hours of our wedding start time. Test results from before 5pm EST on November 17th will not be valid.\n2. A negative rapid test. Results must be returned within 6 hours of our wedding start time. Test results from before 11am EST on November 20th will not be valid.",
    "q-11": "What if I take a PCR test prior to the wedding and it comes back too early? What if it doesn’t come in time at all?",
    "a-11": "As a precaution, we are working on fall-back options for rapid testing.\n\nWe expect COVID testing will become cheaper and more accessible by later this year. If so, we hope to make those options available to our guests if the economics allow.\nThat said, we believe full vaccination will be the best and safest way to enjoy our wedding, and highly encourage it even outside of our event.",
    "q-12": "What if I took a test and it came back negative, but I am feeling sick or unwell?",
    "a-12": "As a precaution, we kindly ask that you stay home—both for your own health and for those at the event.",
    "q-13": "Will you be doing contact tracing?",
    "a-13": "Yes. More information to come here as the event comes closer.",
    "q-14": "How are your vendors preparing?",
    "a-14": "Our vendors have all been thoughtful and gracious partners in planning to make our event safe and successful. At a minimum, they are committed to the same expectations as guests as outlined here.\n\nFor vendors who are handling food or who we expect will be interacting with guests, heighted precautions and preventative measures that have been proposed and which we plan to take, pending their success in the upcoming spring wedding season in the United States and New York City metro areas in particular.\n\nWe expect to learn a lot between now and our wedding, and will share more specific details as we finalize decisions."
