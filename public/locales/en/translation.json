    "l2": "Joanna and Gabe first crossed paths at a fundraiser in midtown Manhattan. They bonded over a shared love of music and the arts—though they disagreed strongly on whether Lang Lang is a great pianist.",
    "l3": "After a few evenings exchanging Spotify lists, watching films, and discovering a shared appreciation for Eataly, Broadway, and cocktail bars—they knew they had found something special in each other. In the years since, they’ve called the diverse community of Long Island City home, while continuing to explore the arts and culinary scene in New York.",
    "l4": "In the fall of 2019, Gabe proposed during a candlelight cruise in the Riviera Maya, Mexico. A year later, Joanna and Gabe were married in an intimate ceremony on October 10, 2020 — as much fun as that was, they can’t wait to celebrate with all of their favorite people.",
    "l5": "They also still disagree on Lang Lang — although they both agree Martha Argerich is better anyway."

A bow tie or slim necktie, as well as patent, velvet, or dark leather shoes, are strongly suggested. In lieu of a tuxedo, a dark-colored suit and crisp, white, collared shirt are acceptable—and a tie is essential.\n- Comfortable dancing shoes are highly encouraged!"

    "subt": "We want to be upfront about the precautions we are taking to provide a safe and comfortable celebration for our family and friends. Following the latest guidelines in New York City, we have made updates to our policy as of August 2021.\n\nThe important things to know are:",
    "s-1": "1. All adult guests must be fully vaccinated and have received their second shot by November 5, 2021. Proof of vaccination is required.",
    "s-2": "2. We would love to have children at our wedding, but leave the decision with each family depending on your comfort level. If you plan to bring them, please let us know when you RSVP!",
    "s-3": "3. We will be doing temperature checks at the door.",
    "s-4": "4. All guests will need to wear face masks when not eating or drinking indoors.",
    "s-5": "5. All guests who are feeling unwell or symptomatic on the day of are encouraged to stay at home and celebrate from afar.",
    "note": "We know these precautions may be inconvenient, but there are no exceptions to these guidelines. We are also very mindful of everyone’s ability to make their own informed decision about vaccination for themselves and their family. In turn, we request careful compliance with precautions as outlined if you plan to attend.\n\nThank you in advance for your understanding. We kindly ask that you check this site regularly for updates as we get closer to November 20th, and we hope to celebrate with you soon!",
    "q-1": "How frequently will you update these guidelines?",
    "a-1": "We continue to make updates to our policy as we track vaccination rates, Delta variant trends, and the latest guidelines from health and government authorities in New York City. All guidance here is being reviewed on an ongoing basis as conditions change from week to week.",
    "q-2": "Will we need to bring masks?",
    "a-2": "Yes. We’ll be evaluating our stance on this and other COVID-related measures in partnership with our venue, Weylin. In general, you can expect that our mask policy will remain very similar to those found in the hospitality, travel, and restaurant industries in New York City.",
    "q-3": "What if I forget to bring my mask?",
    "a-3": "We will have a small supply of disposable masks as a precaution. You’re highly encouraged to bring your own mask, also so that you can coordinate it with your outfit.",
    "q-4": "When will I need to wear a mask?",
    "a-4": "Masks will need to be worn anytime you are not eating or drinking, or are moving around the venue away from your chair or designated table. We recognize this impacts dancing and moving about during reception, so we’re using feedback from Spring/Summer 2021 weddings to inform our approach in the fall.",
    "q-5": "How is mask wearing going to be enforced?",
    "a-5": "We plan to implement a three strike rule: a reminder, a warning, and then being escorted out of the venue. (So until our position on this changes, please wear a mask!)",
    "q-6": "Will social distancing be enforced?",
    "a-6": "Yes. Our venue, Weylin, has a maximum capacity which exceeds our guest count by a healthy margin. As a result, we are fortunate to have a bit more flexibility with our seating arrangements and event flow.\n\nWe’re excited to share more specifics as we get closer, which will be considered alongside our mask policy.",
    "q-7": "Will COVID rapid or PCR testing before the wedding be required?",
    "a-7": "Maybe. We don’t have enough information as of August 2021 to say for certain. Please stay tuned for more information as we track available options. We are closely following developments on the testing front, including but not limited to: speed of testing, cost of individual testing kits, and test efficacy in detecting SARS-Cov-2 and the Delta variant.",
    "q-8": "I am fully vaccinated, do I need to present a negative test result?",
    "a-8": "Not as of August 2021. However, all guests must provide proof of vaccination. You can upload your vaccination records via our RSVP form or by emailing us at hello@joannaandgabriel.love. We will be collecting vaccination details on a rolling basis from guests.\n\nIf you have taken a vaccine that requires a series (Pfizer or AstraZeneca), you will need to have completed both shots. For those who have taken the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, proof of vaccination is sufficient.",
    "q-9": "What if I have not been vaccinated or don’t plan to be?",
    "a-9": "As of August 16, 2021 we are requiring all adult guests in attendance to be vaccinated.\nWe continue to evaluate if testing will be a further precaution we take, but full vaccination is required either way.",
    "q-10": "What kind of COVID tests will be required?",
    "a-10": "For non-vaccinated guests, we will require either of the following at the door prior to entering the venue.\n\n1. A negative PCR test. Results must be returned within 72 hours of our wedding start time. Test results from before 5pm EST on November 17th will not be valid.\n2. A negative rapid test. Results must be returned within 6 hours of our wedding start time. Test results from before 11am EST on November 20th will not be valid.",
    "q-11": "What if I take a PCR test prior to the wedding and it comes back too early? What if it doesn’t come in time at all?",
    "a-11": "As a precaution, we are working on fall-back options for rapid testing.\n\nWe expect COVID testing will become cheaper and more accessible by later this year. If so, we hope to make those options available to our guests if the economics allow. That said, we believe full vaccination will be the best and safest way to enjoy our wedding, and highly encourage it even outside of our event.",
    "q-12": "What if I took a test and it came back negative, but I am feeling sick or unwell?",
    "a-12": "As a precaution, we kindly ask that you stay home—both for your own health and for those at the event.",
    "q-13": "How are your vendors preparing?",
    "a-13": "Our vendors have all been thoughtful and gracious partners in making our event safe and successful.\n\nFor vendors who are handling food or who will be interacting with guests, heightened precautions have been proposed above and beyond their standard food safety procedures.\n\nWe also intend to incorporate the most effective strategies used at various indoor weddings earlier in the year into our own preparations for November. We look forward to sharing more specific details as we finalize those strategies with Weylin and our vendor partners.",
    "q-14": "Do I need to be vaccinated to attend?",
    "a-14": "Yes. We will be requiring full vaccination for all adults in attendance as of August 16, 2021.\nIf you have a medical condition that prevents you from getting the vaccine, please reach out to us.\n\nThis is the date the “Key to the City” vaccination mandate went into effect for indoor dining and entertainment venues in New York City.\nPlease plan to provide proof of vaccination with your RSVP or in advance of the wedding.\n\nIn addition to the RSVP form, you can always email us proof of vaccination at hello@joannaandgabriel.love. \nYou are also encouraged to bring your proof of vaccination with you.\n\nKindly note that as the vaccination mandate applies across venues in New York City, providing proof of vaccination is a policy that our venue security detail will be enforcing very seriously.",
    "q-15": "Why are you requiring vaccinations?",
    "a-15": "As of August 2021, CDC guidelines indicate that “the greatest risk of [COVID] transmission is among unvaccinated people who are much more likely to contract, and therefore transmit the virus.” This is the single biggest step we feel we can take to help reduce any transmission risk during the wedding, in addition to all other precautions listed as part of this policy.\n\nIn addition, guests who are considered vulnerable may be in attendance: our elders, parents and caregivers in regular contact with young children, and expecting mothers. We believe precautions like full vaccination for adults are especially important for reducing risk on their behalf.",
    "q-16": "Are children allowed at the wedding?",
    "a-16": "Yes. We’d love to host your children at the wedding! However, we leave it up to each family to decide their own level of comfort with bringing kids to our celebration. If helpful, we are happy to share trends and feedback from other parents if you'd like to contact us for more information."
